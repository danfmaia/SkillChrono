## EXPERIENCE

### Python/GenAI Developer @ CodeQuery API (side project)

**Sep/2024 – current**

A Python API designed to serve AI assistants with the real-time status of a codebase, by allowing seamless querying of a project's file structure and content, ultimately streamlining AI-driven code analysis and development. While I'm still working on it, it's already operational and available to use.

**Skills developed:** Python, GenAI, RAG, Flask, FastAPI, AI Agents, Custom GPTs, AWS, IaC, Terraform, LangChain

### Creator & Full Stack Developer @ EwD Project

**Jul/2023 – Aug/2024**

English pronunciation teaching methodology based on customizable application of rules and diacritics.

- **Mobile App (Aug/2024 – Aug/2024, 1 months)**  
  Recently, started designing a mobile app as a Proof of Concept (PoC). Plans to apply GenAI Agents, Python, RAG, LangChain, NLP, Flutter/Dart, BLoC, Terraform, among other techs.

- **Website (May/2024 – Aug/2024, 3 months)**  
  Launched the project's website to present the initiative. The core techs applied were Custom GPTs (for development), React, Next.js, Python, MkDocs, HTML/CSS, and Vercel.

- **NLP Tools (Dec/2023 – Mar/2024, 3 months)**  
  Through many iterations with different RAG-enabled GenAI agents, developed a Python/Flask API (namely IDP API) and a Python CLI (namely Lexicon CLI), NLP tools aimed at exploring the possibilities of the approach.  
  The GenAI iterations impactfully assisted in many stages of the development cycle, such as analysis, design, coding, testing, and documentation. The results of all these processes are available on GitHub.

- **Conception (Oct/2023 – May/2024, 7 months)**  
  Through months of research and GenAI iterations, produced the documentation on the core principles and didactics behind the English with Diacritics (EwD) initiative. At this early stage, the approach has already had a positive impact on some people's understanding and performance in English pronunciation, as later evidenced by the positive results of a feedback form.

**Skills developed:** GenAI, Agentic AI, Custom GPTs, RAG, Python, Flask, React, Next.js, HTML/CSS, Markdown, MkDocs, Test-Driven Development, Development Lifecycle, Problem Solving, Critical thinking, Organization
