### **5. "Can you explain the SOLID principles and why they’re important?"**

**Answer:**

"Sure! The SOLID principles are five design principles that help create more maintainable and flexible software:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class or module should have one responsibility, making it easier to modify and understand.
2. **Open/Closed Principle**: Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification, allowing for new functionality without changing existing code.
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Objects of a subclass should be replaceable for their base class without affecting the system’s correctness.
4. **Interface Segregation Principle**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don’t use. It’s better to have smaller, specific interfaces.
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

These principles ensure that code is modular, easy to test, and resilient to changes, which is crucial in large-scale applications."

### **6. "How do you apply Clean Code practices in your projects?"**

**Answer:**

"I follow Clean Code practices by prioritizing **readability** and **simplicity**. This means:

1. Using **meaningful names** for variables, functions, and classes.
2. Writing **small, single-purpose functions** that do one thing and do it well.
3. Avoiding code duplication and implementing **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)** principles.
4. Adding **clear comments** only when necessary to explain complex logic.
5. Structuring code to follow a **consistent style**, making it easy for other developers to understand and maintain.

Additionally, I adopt **refactoring** as a regular practice to keep codebases clean and ensure that as features grow, code quality is not compromised. These principles result in code that’s not only functional but also easy to read and extend."
